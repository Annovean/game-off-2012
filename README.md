### The Game

This game was created for Github's Game Off 2012. This has undergone
development in less than 48 hours which also includes trying learning
Unity itself. ;)

You are a circular entity that needs to absorb all other entities around
you. You control your entity using the arrow keys or the usual WASD
keys. Press `Q` to split yourself into 2. You may access the game at
this URL: [game-off-2012.herokuapp.com](http://game-off-2012.herokuapp.com)
